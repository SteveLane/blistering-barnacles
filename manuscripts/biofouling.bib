              the yachts surveyed were found to have macrofouling attached to

  abstract = "Multiple imputation has become a popular approach for analyzing
              incomplete data. Many software packages are available to multiply
              impute the missing values and to analyze the resulting completed
              data sets. However, diagnostic tools to check the validity of the
              imputations are limited, and the majority of the currently
              available methods need considerable knowledge of the imputation
              model. In many practical settings, however, the imputer and the
              analyst may be different individuals or from different
              organizations, and the analyst model may or may not be congenial
              to the model used by the imputer. This article develops and
              evaluates a set of graphical and numerical diagnostic tools for
              two practical purposes: (i) for an analyst to determine whether
              the imputations are reasonable under his/her model assumptions
              without actually knowing the imputation model assumptions; and
              (ii) for an imputer to fine tune the imputation model by checking
              the key characteristics of the observed and imputed values. The
              tools are based on the numerical and graphical comparisons of the
              distributions of the observed and imputed values conditional on
              the propensity of response. The methodology is illustrated using
              simulated data sets created under a variety of scenarios. The
              examples focus on continuous and binary variables, but the

  author   = "Burton, Andrea and Billingham, Lucinda Jane and Bryan, Stirling",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness has become an important outcome in
              many clinical trials and has resulted in the collection of
              resource use data and the calculation of costs for individual
              patients. A specific example is a Cancer Research UK phase III
              trial comparing chemotherapy (CT) against standard palliative
              care in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
              Resource usage from trial entry until death were collected and
              costs obtained on a subset of 115 trial patients. For some
              patients, however, the unavailability of medical notes resulted
              in some cost components, and hence total cost, being missing. The
              82 patients with complete data were not representative of all
              trial patients in terms of effectiveness and thus it was
              necessary to address the missing data problem. METHODS: Multiple
              imputation (MI) was used to impute values for the unobserved
              individual cost components, allowing total cost to be calculated
              and cost-effectiveness carried out for all patients in the cost
              sub-study. The results are compared with those from a complete
              case analysis. RESULTS: After MI, the results indicated that CT
              had a high probability of being cost-effective for a societal
              willingness to pay over 20,000 Pounds per life-year gained. This
              was in stark contrast with the complete case analysis, which
              suggested that CT was not a cost-effective use of resources at
              any reasonable level of willingness to pay for a life-year.
              LIMITATIONS: Our findings are based on a relatively small
              retrospective study with all events observed. CONCLUSION: In
              conclusion, cost-effectiveness analysis of the complete cases
              only may give biased results, and therefore, in situations where
              there are missing costs, MI is recommended.",

  abstract  = "Invasive non-indigenous species are among the greatest threats
               to global biodiversity. Shipping is the principal vector for
               international dispersal of nonindigenous species, and shipping
               rates are increasing globally. The Australian government
               performs a range of regulatory actions to mitigate biosecurity
               risks associated with marine vessels, and in so doing has
               amassed a large volume of operational inspection data. This data
               can be used to quantitatively examine risk factors of vessels
               failing biosecurity procedures after arriving from international
               ports, the nature of biosecurity failures, and the types and
               seizure rates of biosecurity risk material (BRM). Classification
               trees with gradient boosting were used to assess characteristics
               that predict high risk vessels (n = 93,006) for carrying BRM,
               across 7 years of inspection data. Undeclared vessels and
               suspected irregular entry vessels posed the highest risk, but
               both were rare. Vessels that visit infrequently (<20 visits in 7
               years) were common and had almost three times greater odds of
               failing inspection than vessels visiting frequently. On
               statistical analysis, yachts appeared to pose less risk than
               commercial vessels. In operational terms, a tentative profiled
               20\% fraction would contain 57\% of genuine failures, and the
               concomitant non-screened group would contain 82\% of passes. The
               most common reason for inspection failures was ballast water
               non-compliance (2.53\%) and plant or insect detections (1.77\%);
               biofouling was less common (0.13\%) but testing for biofouling
               is not exhaustive. Invertebrate species comprised almost 90\% of
               invasive organisms detected and seized from vessels failing
               biosecurity inspections. This study targets an entire
               transportation vector, which includes many pathways.
               Understanding the characteristics of transport vectors is
               pivotal to characterising the risk of biological invasions and
               applying adequate controls and prevention strategies. Our
               results show that biosecurity risk is not uniform on maritime
               pathways, so there is considerable scope for biosecurity
               regulators to impose risk-based intervention.",

              large studies. The current gold standard to account for missing
              data is multiple imputation, and more specifically multiple
              imputation with chained equations (MICE). Numerous studies have
              been conducted to illustrate the performance of MICE for missing
              covariate data. The results show that the method works well in
              various situations. However, less is known about its performance
              in more complex models, specifically when the outcome is
              multivariate as in longitudinal studies. In current practice, the
              multivariate nature of the longitudinal outcome is often
              neglected in the imputation procedure, or only the baseline
              outcome is used to impute missing covariates. In this work, we
              evaluate the performance of MICE using different strategies to
              include a longitudinal outcome into the imputation models and
              compare it with a fully Bayesian approach that jointly imputes
              missing values and estimates the parameters of the longitudinal
              model. Results from simulation and a real data example show that
              MICE requires the analyst to correctly specify which components
              of the longitudinal process need to be included in the imputation
              models in order to obtain unbiased results. The full Bayesian
              approach, on the other hand, does not require the analyst to
              explicitly specify how the longitudinal outcome enters the
              imputation models. It performed well under different scenarios.

               wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear
               regression and multilevel models. The book introduces a wide
               variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the
               reader in how to fit these models using available software
               packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through
               scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors'
               own applied research, with programming codes provided for each
               one. Topics covered include causal inference, including
               regression, poststratification, matching, regression
               discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel
               logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips
               regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided

              Arriving to New Zealand}",
  author   = "Georgiades, Eugene and Kluza, Daniel",
  abstract = "Abstract Vessel biofouling is a significant pathway for the
              introduction of nonindigenous marine species (NIMS). New Zealand
              is the first nation to regulate the vessel biofouling pathway,
              with controls scheduled to come into force in May 2018. The Craft
              Risk Management Standard (CRMS): Biofouling on Vessels Arriving
              to New Zealand specifies the hull fouling thresholds that vessels
              must meet; and here, we present the evidence-based decisions that
              underpin these thresholds.Under the CRMS, a vessel must arrive in
              New Zealand with a ``clean hull,'' the thresholds for which are
              governed by the intended duration of a vessel's stay in New
              Zealand. For example, long-stay (≥21 days) vessels must meet a
              more stringent standard of hull cleanliness due to the increased
              likelihood of release and establishment of NIMS. While setting a
              clean hull threshold at ``slime layer only'' can be tractable
              when vessels operate within the specifications of antifouling
              coatings, incidental amounts of macrofouling can establish even
              under the best management practices. Because of such instances,
              the thresholds within the CRMS were designed to allow for the
              presence of some macrofouling species, albeit with restrictions
              to minimize biosecurity risk. These thresholds are intended to
              limit species richness and to prevent successful reproduction and
              settlement of the allowed taxonomic groups while considering the
              practicality and feasibility of implementation.The difficulties
              of managing biofouling on different areas of the hull are
              acknowledged within these thresholds. For example, a greater
              tolerance of macrofouling has been allowed for niche areas due to
              the difficulties in preventing biofouling on these areas.",

  abstract = "Statistical analysis in epidemiologic studies is often hindered
              by missing data, and multiple imputation is increasingly being
              used to handle this problem. In a simulation study, the authors
              compared 2 methods for imputation that are widely available in
              standard software: fully conditional specification (FCS) or
              ``chained equations'' and multivariate normal imputation (MVNI).
              The authors created data sets of 1,000 observations to simulate a
              cohort study, and missing data were induced under 3 missing-data
              mechanisms. Imputations were performed using FCS (Royston's
              ``ice'') and MVNI (Schafer's NORM) in Stata (Stata Corporation,
              College Station, Texas), with transformations or prediction
              matching being used to manage nonnormality in the continuous
              variables. Inferences for a set of regression parameters were
              compared between these approaches and a complete-case analysis.
              As expected, both FCS and MVNI were generally less biased than
              complete-case analysis, and both produced similar results despite
              the presence of binary and ordinal variables that clearly did not
              follow a normal distribution. Ignoring skewness in a continuous
              covariate led to large biases and poor coverage for the
              corresponding regression parameter under both approaches,
              although inferences for other parameters were largely unaffected.
              These results provide reassurance that similar results can be
              expected from FCS and MVNI in a standard regression analysis
              involving variously scaled variables.",

              ``fill-in'' values randomly selected from an appropriate

              parameter estimates but may produce biased variance estimates and
              thereby distort inference when 30\% or more of the data are below
              detection limits. Truncated data methods (e.g., Tobit regression)
              and multiple imputation offer two unbiased approaches for
              analyzing measurement data with detection limits. If interest
              resides solely on regression parameters, then Tobit regression
              can be used. If individualized values for measurements below
              detection limits are needed for additional analysis, such as
              relative risk regression or graphical display, then multiple
              imputation produces unbiased estimates and nominal confidence
              intervals unless the proportion of missing data is extreme. We
              illustrate various approaches using measurements of pesticide
              residues in carpet dust in control subjects from a case-control

  abstract = "Summary In a typical randomized clinical trial, a continuous
              variable of interest (e.g., bone density) is measured at baseline
              and fixed postbaseline time points. The resulting longitudinal
              data, often incomplete due to dropouts and other reasons, are
              commonly analyzed using parametric likelihood-based methods that
              assume multivariate normality of the response vector. If the
              normality assumption is deemed untenable, then semiparametric
              methods such as (weighted) generalized estimating equations are
              considered. We propose an alternate approach in which the missing
              data problem is tackled using multiple imputation, and each
              imputed dataset is analyzed using robust regression
              (M-estimation; Huber, 1973, Annals of Statistics1, 799-821.) to
              protect against potential non-normality/outliers in the original
              or imputed dataset. The robust analysis results from each imputed
              dataset are combined for overall estimation and inference using
              either the simple Rubin (1987, Multiple Imputation for
              Nonresponse in Surveys, New York: Wiley) method, or the more
              complex but potentially more accurate Robins and Wang (2000,
              Biometrika87, 113-124.) method. We use simulations to show that
              our proposed approach performs at least as well as the standard
              methods under normality, but is notably better under both
              elliptically symmetric and asymmetric non-normal distributions. A
              clinical trial example is used for illustration.",

               constructor and the ultimate user are distinct entities. The
               objective is valid frequency inference for ultimate users who in

               limited knowledge of specific reasons and models for

               multiple imputation by the data-base constructor is the method
               of choice. This article first provides a description of the
               assumed context and objectives, and second, reviews the multiple

              ``true'' imputation model may contain nonlinearities which are
              not included in default imputation models. Random forest
              imputation is a machine learning technique which can accommodate
              nonlinearities and interactions and does not require a particular
              regression model to be specified. We compared parametric MICE
              with a random forest-based MICE algorithm in 2 simulation
              studies. The first study used 1,000 random samples of 2,000
              persons drawn from the 10,128 stable angina patients in the
              CALIBER database (Cardiovascular Disease Research using Linked

              estimates obtained using different imputation methods were
              compared. Both MICE methods produced unbiased estimates of (log)
              hazard ratios, but random forest was more efficient and produced
              narrower confidence intervals. The second study used simulated
              data in which the partially observed variable depended on the
              fully observed variables in a nonlinear way. Parameter estimates
              were less biased using random forest MICE, and confidence
              interval coverage was better. This suggests that random forest

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput
              technology is often facing the problem of missing data.
              Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data
              often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a
              solution to this problem. However, the majority of available
              imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only:
              continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different
              types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods
              ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a
              non-parametric method which can cope with different types of
              variables simultaneously. RESULTS: We compare several state of
              the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose
              and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on
              a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification
              or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a
              multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error
              estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the
              imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is
              performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of
              biological fields with artificially introduced missing values
              ranging from 10\% to 30\%. We show that missForest can
              successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets
              including different types of variables. In our comparative study,
              missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in
              data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations
              are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of
              missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally,
              missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can
              cope with high-dimensional data. AVAILABILITY: The package
              missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.

  abstract = "Multiple imputation is commonly used to impute missing data, and
              is typically more efficient than complete cases analysis in
              regression analysis when covariates have missing values.
              Imputation may be performed using a regression model for the
              incomplete covariates on other covariates and, importantly, on
              the outcome. With a survival outcome, it is a common practice to
              use the event indicator D and the log of the observed event or
              censoring time T in the imputation model, but the rationale is
              not clear.We assume that the survival outcome follows a
              proportional hazards model given covariates X and Z. We show that
              a suitable model for imputing binary or Normal X is a logistic or
              linear regression on the event indicator D, the cumulative
              baseline hazard H(0)(T), and the other covariates Z. This result
              is exact in the case of a single binary covariate; in other
              cases, it is approximately valid for small covariate effects
              and/or small cumulative incidence. If we do not know H(0)(T), we
              approximate it by the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H(T) or estimate
              it by Cox regression.We compare the methods using simulation
              studies. We find that using logT biases covariate-outcome
              associations towards the null, while the new methods have lower
              bias. Overall, we recommend including the event indicator and the
              Nelson-Aalen estimator of H(T) in the imputation model.",

  author   = "Zhou, Xiang and Reiter, Jerome P",
  abstract = "This article is aimed at practitioners who plan to use Bayesian
              inference on multiply-imputed datasets in settings where
              posterior distributions of the parameters of interest are not
              approximately Gaussian. We seek to steer practitioners away from
              a naive approach to Bayesian inference, namely estimating the
              posterior distribution in each completed dataset and averaging
              functionals of these distributions. We demonstrate that this
              approach results in unreliable inferences. A better approach is
              to mix draws from the posterior distributions from each completed
              dataset, and use the mixed draws to summarize the posterior
              distribution. Using simulations, we show that for this second
              approach to work well, the number of imputed datasets should be
              large. In particular, five to ten imputed datasets—which is the
              standard recommendation for multiple imputation—is generally not
              enough to result in reliable Bayesian inferences.",
