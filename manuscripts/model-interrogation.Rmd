## Introduction

In this document, I detail the model interrogation for the *blistering barnacles* (otherwise known as *biofouling*) project. For the introduction and set up of the problem, see the [manuscript](file:../manuscripts/censored-mle.pdf). This document expands upon the modelling description as given in that paper.

## Models

The basic model (which we denote M0) included the location of the measurement as a level one fixed effect, and a modelled intercept for the vessel ID:

$$
\begin{align}
  Y_{i} & \sim \text{log-normal}(\mu_{i}, \sigma) \\
  \mu_{i} & = \mu + \alpha_{j[i]} + \beta^{l1} \cdot \text{location1}_{i} + \beta^{l2} \cdot \text{location2}_{i} \\
  \alpha_{j} & \sim \text{cauchy}(0, \sigma_{\alpha}) \\
  \mu & \sim N(0, 5) \\
  \beta^{l1},\beta^{l2} & \sim t_{3}(0, 1) \\
  \sigma,\sigma_{\alpha} & \sim \text{cauchy}(0, 2.5)
\end{align}
$$

where $\text{location1}_{i},\text{location2}_{i}$ are indicator variables for whether the observation was measured at the keel or the rudder; observations made at the hull are aliased with the intercept, $\mu$. Summary output from this model is given below.

```{r}
m0 <- readRDS("../data/censored-mle-m0.rds")
m0ll <- extract_log_lik(m0)
m0loo <- loo(m0ll)
print(m0, digits = 2, include = FALSE,
      par = c("alphaBoat", "muHat", "muHatCens", "log_lik", "alphaHat"))

```

The next model fit (M1) included all vessel-level predictors as main effects in a regression on the vessel-level intercept:

$$
\begin{align}
  \alpha_{j} & \sim \text{cauchy}(\alpha^{*}_{j}, \sigma_{\alpha}) \\
  \alpha^{*}_{j} & = \beta^{d1} \cdot \text{days1}_{i} + \beta^{d2} \cdot  \text{days2}_{i} + \beta^{m} \cdot \text{midTrips}_{i} + \beta^{h} \cdot \text{hullSA}_{i} + \beta^{p1} \cdot \text{paintType1}_{i} + \beta^{p2} \cdot \text{paintType2}_{i} + \\
  & \quad \beta^{t1} \cdot \text{vesselType1}_{i} + \beta^{t2} \cdot \text{vesselType2}_{i}
\end{align}
$$

where $\text{days1}_{i},\text{days2}_{i}$ are the XXX. Summary output from this model is given below.

```{r}
m1 <- readRDS("../data/censored-mle-m1.rds")
m1ll <- extract_log_lik(m1)
m1loo <- loo(m1ll)
print(m1, digits = 2, include = FALSE,
      par = c("alphaBoat", "muHat", "muHatCens", "log_lik", "alphaHat"))

```

## Vessel-level intercept interrogation

In this section we look at the estimated vessel-level intercepts ($\alpha_{j}$) in relation to the vessel-level predictors. From the output above, it is hard to gauge the impact of a product term, but the size of the 50% point estimate of the vessel type coefficients suggest that they may be candidates.

### Candidate interaction terms

The figure below shows the 50% point estimate (and 80% credible intervals) of the vessel-level intercept against the ordinal predictors, coloured by the vessel type. There is a possibility of an interaction between `days1`/`midTrips` and `boatType`.

```{r}
a1 <- extract(m1, "alphaBoat")$alphaBoat
a1Sum <- t(apply(a1, 2, quantile, probs = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9)))
a1Dat <- tibble(low = a1Sum[,1], mid = a1Sum[,2], high = a1Sum[,3],
                boatID = 1:nrow(a1Sum))
imps <- readRDS("../data/imputations.rds")
set.seed(13)
lvl2 <- imps[[sample(seq_along(imps), 1)]]$lvl2
a1Dat <- left_join(a1Dat, lvl2) %>%
    gather(type, value, -low, -mid, -high, -boatID, -paintType, -boatType)
slopes <- extract(m1, c("mu", "betaDays1", "betaDays2", "betaMidTrips",
                        "betaHullSA"))
slopes <- sapply(slopes, quantile, probs = 0.5)
slopes <- tibble(intercept = slopes[1], slope = slopes[-1],
                 type = unique(a1Dat$type))
pl <- ggplot(a1Dat, aes(x = value, y = mid, ymin = low, ymax = high,
                        colour = boatType)) +
    geom_pointrange(fatten = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~ type) +
    geom_abline(aes(slope = slope, intercept = intercept), data = slopes) +
    theme_bw()
print(pl)

```

The next figure is similar to above, but it shows the points coloured by paint type. This plot is suggestive of an interaction between `midTrips` and `paintType`.

```{r}
pl <- ggplot(a1Dat, aes(x = value, y = mid, ymin = low, ymax = high,
                        colour = paintType)) +
    geom_pointrange(fatten = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~ type) +
    geom_abline(aes(slope = slope, intercept = intercept), data = slopes) +
    theme_bw()
print(pl)

```

So combining these two exploratory data analyses, and the results from M1, a possible sequence of models to try next would be: M2, which removes `hullSA` from M1; and M3 which adds the `days1:boatType`, `midTrips:boatType` and `midTrips:paintType` interactions to M2.

### Interrogation of product terms

The choice of predictors in M2 was made based on the candidate interaction terms in M3. Removing `hullSA` from M1 resulted in the following estimates for M2:

```{r}
m2 <- readRDS("../data/censored-mle-m2.rds")
m2ll <- extract_log_lik(m2)
m2loo <- loo(m2ll)
m2comp <- compare(m1loo, m2loo)
print(m2, digits = 2, include = FALSE,
      par = c("alphaBoat", "muHat", "muHatCens", "log_lik", "alphaHat"))

```

As can be seen in these estimates, there is virtually no change in values from that in M1. Further, the difference in the expected log predictive density between the two models is very small: `r m2comp[1]` (`r m2comp[2]`), providing further evidence the two models are essentially the same.

Moving on to M3, where the interactions `days1:boatType`, `midTrips:boatType` and `midTrips:paintType` are added to M2, we get the following estimates:

```{r}
m3 <- readRDS("../data/censored-mle-m3.rds")
m3ll <- extract_log_lik(m3)
m3loo <- loo(m3ll)
print(m3, digits = 2, include = FALSE,
      par = c("alphaBoat", "muHat", "muHatCens", "log_lik", "alphaHat"))

```

Again, there is not enough evidence to state with any certainty how these interactions might affect the wet weight biomass. It is important to remember that there are only `r nrow(a1Dat)` vessels contributing to the regression at the second-level, so we do not expect very small standard errors for these estimates.

```{r}
a3 <- extract(m3, "alphaBoat")$alphaBoat
a3Sum <- t(apply(a3, 2, quantile, probs = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9)))
a3Dat <- tibble(low = a3Sum[,1], mid = a3Sum[,2], high = a3Sum[,3],
                boatID = 1:nrow(a3Sum))
a3Dat <- left_join(a3Dat, lvl2) %>%
    select(-ApproxHullSA, -days2) %>%
    gather(type, value, -low, -mid, -high, -boatID, -paintType, -boatType)
slopes <- extract(m3, c("mu", "betaDays1", "betaDays2", "betaMidTrips",
                        "betaPaint", "betaType", "betaDaysType",
                        "betaTripsType", "betaTripsPaint"))
intType <- c(0, median(slopes$betaType[,1]), median(slopes$betaType[,2]))
slopeDaysType <- c(median(slopes$betaDays1),
                   median(slopes$betaDays1 + slopes$betaDaysType[,1]),
                   median(slopes$betaDays1 + slopes$betaDaysType[,2]))
slopeTripsType <- c(median(slopes$betaMidTrips),
                    median(slopes$betaMidTrips + slopes$betaTripsType[,1]),
                    median(slopes$betaMidTrips + slopes$betaTripsType[,2]))
parsType <- tibble(intercept = rep(intType, 2),
                   slope = c(slopeDaysType, slopeTripsType),
                   boatType = factor(rep(levels(a3Dat$boatType), 2)),
                   type = rep(c("days1", "midTrips"), each = 3))
pl <- ggplot(a3Dat, aes(x = value, y = mid, ymin = low, ymax = high,
                        colour = boatType)) +
    geom_pointrange(fatten = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~ type, ncol = 2) +
    geom_abline(aes(slope = slope, intercept = intercept, colour = boatType),
                data = parsType) +    
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
print(pl)


```

The figure above plots the marginal regression lines for the `days1:boatType` and `midTrips:boatType` interactions. There appears to be a difference in slopes in the `days1:boatType` interaction; indeed the posterior probability that the difference in slopes between Yachts and Motor cruiser/Other is greater than 0 is `r mean(slopes$betaDaysType[,2] - slopes$betaDaysType[,1] > 0)`.

The figure below plots the marginal regression line for the `midTrips:paintType` interaction. There appears to be no difference in slopes here.

```{r}
intPaint <- c(0, median(slopes$betaPaint[,1]), median(slopes$betaPaint[,2]))
slopeTripsPaint <- c(median(slopes$betaMidTrips),
                     median(slopes$betaMidTrips + slopes$betaTripsPaint[,1]),
                     median(slopes$betaMidTrips + slopes$betaTripsPaint[,2]))
parsType <- tibble(intercept = intPaint,
                   slope = slopeTripsPaint,
                   paintType = factor(levels(a3Dat$paintType)),
                   type = rep("midTrips", each = 3))
pl <- ggplot(a3Dat %>% filter(type == "midTrips"),
             aes(x = value, y = mid, ymin = low, ymax = high,
                 colour = paintType)) +
    geom_pointrange(fatten = 1) +
    geom_abline(aes(slope = slope, intercept = intercept, colour = paintType),
                data = parsType) +    
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
print(pl)

```

## Restricted model form

I think the appropriate place to go now is to eliminate terms that don't appear to add any predictive ability to the model. We'll keep the `days1:boatType` interaction (and its components), but remove other predictors. The final model M4, will thus have a vessel-level regression form:

$$
\begin{align}
  \alpha^{*}_{j} & = \beta^{d1} \cdot \text{days1}_{i} + \beta^{d2} \cdot  \text{days2}_{i} + \beta^{t1} \cdot \text{vesselType1}_{i} + \beta^{t2} \cdot \text{vesselType2}_{i} + \\
  & \quad \beta^{dt1} \cdot \text{days1vesselType1}_{i} + \beta^{dt2} \cdot \text{days1vesselType2}_{i}
\end{align}
$$

where $\text{days1vesselType1}_{i},\text{days1vesselType2}_{i}$ are the interaction terms.
